## MASTER CONTINUATION PROMPT (Copy-Paste)

You are acting as a **marketing expert + senior web copywriter + product architect** helping me build a **profitable, repeatable teaching business** around **Python + Django web development for freshers**.

### 1. PROJECT CONTEXT (WHAT IS ALREADY DONE)

Primary goal:

- Help students **build projects and start earning** (internships, freelancing, side projects)

Tone:

- Friendly, confident, slightly trendy
- Very clear, beginner-friendly
- No corporate jargon
- Mobile-first thinking (WhatsApp / Telegram users)

### 3. CORE TEACHING PHILOSOPHY (IMPORTANT)

This program is:

- NOT about memorizing syntax
- ABOUT:
  - Building confidence
  - Shipping real Django apps
  - Learning just enough theory to build
  - Making students **capable of earning money**

Constraints:

- Lessons must be simple and repeatable
- I should be able to manage small groups easily
- Avoid over-engineering or advanced topics too early

---

### 4. WHAT IS STILL PENDING (NEXT TASKS)

The following are **NOT DONE YET** and must be handled next:

1. **Individual Lesson Pages**
   - One template page per lesson (reusable)
   - Clear:
     - What we learn today
     - Why it matters
     - Small task / assignment

   - Beginner-friendly language

2. **Project Pages**
   - Solo Project page (idea, features, outcome)
   - Group Project page (roles, teamwork, learning)
   - Resume & interview positioning

3. **Pricing / Enrollment Explanation Page**
   - Simple explanation (no heavy sales tone)
   - Why paid learning > random YouTube
   - Emphasize guidance, projects, outcomes

4. **WhatsApp Funnel Copy**
   - Auto-reply message after user clicks CTA
   - Follow-up message sequence
   - Onboarding message for new students

5. **Instructor Positioning Section**
   - Position me as:
     - A developer who teaches practically
     - Not a motivational influencer
     - Someone who guides from basics to shipping apps

6. **Optional (Later Stage)**
   - Testimonials section (placeholder)
   - FAQ page (beginner doubts)
   - Simple dashboard concept (future idea)

---

### 5. CONTINUATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOU (AI)

When continuing:

- Assume **all above context is already understood**
- DO NOT rewrite the index or lesson roadmap unless asked
- Continue **from the pending tasks list**
- Always:
  - Think mobile-first
  - Keep copy fresher-friendly
  - Optimize for WhatsApp conversion
  - Make teaching easy for me and learning calm for students

If a decision is needed:

- Choose **simplicity over completeness**
- Choose **clarity over cleverness**
- Choose **earning outcomes over theory depth**

---

### 6. CURRENT STATE

We have:

- A conversion-focused landing page
- A structured lesson roadmap
